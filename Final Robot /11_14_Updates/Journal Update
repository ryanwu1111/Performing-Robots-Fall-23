For today, as we have finally finished building the two major parts of our body base, we shifted our focus for today onto figuring out all the proper wiring for the power for all the different parts: Arduino Mega & Uno, Servo Shield, Music Maker shield, Servomotors' power and pins, etc. 

It was extremely confusing for us to understand what goes where and how and why it goes there at first. What made it worse was that there were no other group's robots where we could use as reference either because they weren't using two big servomotors like us or some were not at the same working stage as us yet. However, we managed to find a group's robot as reference: thank you Marta and Aakif! Even though their group only used one small servomotor, we were able to easily understand how and why they wired every single part of their robots and we applied this logic back to our own robot. 

Even though it took quite a while to figure things out, we were able to vaguely figure out what and how we had to wire everything up for our robot. We concluded our day by figuring out a vague idea how we had wire everything up and started a bit first.
