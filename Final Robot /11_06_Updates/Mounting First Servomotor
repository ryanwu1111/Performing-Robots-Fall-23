On this day, Andres and I were able to fully understand the concept on how to control the rotation using servomotors as well as a Lazy Susan. We were able to test it out with a sample using two small pieces of cardboard (as shown in the video). After showing this to the Professor, we moved on to applying the servomotor and Lazy Susan to a full scaled size of cardboard we were going to use for our final robot. 
We concluded this day by successfully first mounting the first of two servomotors and Lazy Susan onto a full scaled piece of cardboard we're going to use for our final robot.
