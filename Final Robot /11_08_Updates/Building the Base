After mounting the first servomotor and Lazy Susan onto a full scaled cardboard, we utilized the lab session today to build the body of the base where the first servomotor and Lazy Susan will be placed on top of. 

The most tedious part of today was making all the detailed measurements, drilling all the holes, screwing all the L-shaped connectors(?) to keep all the sides of the base held together as firm as possible. 

We concluded this day by finish building all three sides and connecting them all together for the first base that's directly attached to the moving base.
