For this day, we noticed that since the bottom base is going to be sustaining the most weight at the bottom, therefore, we thought that it was important that the sides do not cave inwards. Hence, we decided to add some small pieces of wood and stick it to the adjacent parts of the cardboards that were connected to each other (as shown in the pictures). We completed this by using the wood glue in the lab in order to make sure that they will stick firmly. We concluded our day with this task.
