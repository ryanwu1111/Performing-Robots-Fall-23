Today, we moved on to starting the process of building the second base with the second Lazy Susan that was going on top of the first one. The process of building the second base with the servomotor and Lazy Susan wasn't as difficult this time as we knew what we had to do as well as all the minor details we had to keep an eye out for. 

We also succeeded in securing the cardboard side with the servomotor and Lazy Susan for the bottom base to the other three sides using the L-shaped connector(?) parts. 

However, we encountered a small issue with the Lazy Susan where whenever the servomotor starts spinning, there is this weird sound that keeps coming out from the Lazy Susan. We concluded this day without being able to resolve the weird noise problem, planning to ask Professor about what's the cause and where the weird noise was coming from.
