Today, we managed to finally figure out everything from the different dialogues, the movement of the two servomotors, the neopixels, controlling the movement of the wheels using the remote controller, and finally transmitting the different states using the trasnmitter. 

A major thing that we discovered and changed today was the angles of our servomotors that were turning in. We realized today that we could not simply make both of the servomotors turn towards the same angle if we wanted to realign both of them to the center. When we first tried it, the upper servomotor (neck) ended up turning to an extremely awkward angle to the point that the wires from the power cable broke off. We found the solution to this: we can't simply make both servomotors turn towards the same angle at the same time, we needed to take into consideration that the upper servomotor (neck) would move in accordance to the bottom servomotor (body). So, we found the solution to this by fixing the angles for both servomotors and making sure that the bottom servomotor (body) was always turning to a lower angle than the upper servomotor (neck) by a difference of 50 degrees. For example, our 'neutral' state facing forwards, we would make the bottom servomotor turn to an angle of 40 degree while the upper servomotor would turn to an angle of 90. 

Going forwards, we just need to decoarte our robot further by adding more paint and strips to make it look more similar to a pinata and if we have more time, we will also try to make animations to our neopixels to make it look more dynamic and lively.
