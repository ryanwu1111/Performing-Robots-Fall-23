For our robot, Andres and I started with a few sketches after deciding our script for our particular drama/dialogue as our overall script was not yet finalized. 
Within our sketch, we decided to use a pinata because our partner's robot is going to be cactus, so we thought it would be interesting to use a pinata and give our drama a comedic feeling to it. We included some details of where the servo motors will be used as well as the exoskeleton that we plan to install inside the body to bring all the wires and servomotors.
