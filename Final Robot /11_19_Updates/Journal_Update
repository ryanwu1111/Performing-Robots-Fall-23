For this day, Andres and I focused mainly on making sure that both servomotors are able to turn successfully without any interferences. After a while of working and tinkering, we were able to make sure that the two servomotors turned successfully on its own. 

Furthermore, we also decided to test out the remote controller still works and could control the wheel movements. As expected, it was working perfectly fine as we could move it forwards, backwards, and even turning left and right.
