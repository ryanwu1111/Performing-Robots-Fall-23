## _Sketching Assignment with Partner_ (09/14)
For the sketching assignment, Andres and I met up and immediately started throwing ideas of how we wanted our robot body to look like, and after a few while, we decided our theme to be on **larva masks** 

Therefore, after expanding further on the theme of larva masks, we came up with the idea of making our robot body have 3 to 4 different kinds of facial expressions in the shape of larva masks on each side (as seen in 'Sketch #1'). We thought this would be a simple yet creative idea as this can be also alluded to the various emotions that we tend to display on a daily basis, giving the robot body a human feeling to it.

Another key aspect to our robot is the method we plan to attach everything together. Instead of sticking the four pieces of cardboard for the body together, we decided that it would be more efficient and sturdier if we specifically designed wedges or 'holes'. This way all we have to do is fit the four pieces of cardboard together like legos. 

Lastly, we plan to make the facial expressions on top of our robot body by sculpting them with paper-mache (as shown in 'Sketch #2').

## _First Robot Base Update_ (09/18)

Overall, there weren't any serious or huge problems that we encountered throughout the whole process of building our base. 

We first started off by attaching the motors onto the black ridges on both edges of the base, and at first we were a little bit confused as to how we were supposed to secure the ridges tightly, as the ridges were still a little wobbly. We resolved the problem by simply drilling two more holes in the space and inserting two more screws to secure the ridges.

Personally, even though I did learn some soldering techniques during my study away in New York, I thought that I still needed a little refresher course for soldering. Hence, I took a little crash course with Shiloh about soldering and actually learned a few new stuff about soldering, such as using the heat-shrinking tube to cover over the solder parts of the wires afterwards. But eventually, I was able to solder all four wires for the motors by myself, yay!

After we were done with the soldering, we moved on and drilled holes for the motor wires to be put through onto the other side as well as holes for the battery pack to be strapped securely. We also decided to not hot glue the Arduino board and instead drilled holes onto the board as we saw that there were actually alread holes on it and secured it with screws. Lastly, we strapped the battery pack in a diagonal manner and fit all the motor wires through the holes onto the other side of the base.
