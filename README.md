## _Sketching Assignment with Partner_ (09/14)
For the sketching assignment, Andres and I met up and immediately started throwing ideas of how we wanted our robot body to look like, and after a few while, we decided our theme to be on **larva masks** 

Therefore, after expanding further on the theme of larva masks, we came up with the idea of making our robot body have 3 to 4 different kinds of facial expressions in the shape of larva masks on each side (as seen in 'Sketch #1'). We thought this would be a simple yet creative idea as this can be also alluded to the various emotions that we tend to display on a daily basis, giving the robot body a human feeling to it.

Another key aspect to our robot is the method we plan to attach everything together. Instead of sticking the four pieces of cardboard for the body together, we decided that it would be more efficient and sturdier if we specifically designed wedges or 'holes'. This way all we have to do is fit the four pieces of cardboard together like legos. 

Lastly, we plan to make the facial expressions on top of our robot body by sculpting them with paper-mache (as shown in 'Sketch #2').
